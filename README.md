# 📦 Machine Learning Library (MLPipelineKit)

A modular Python library that streamlines the process of building and deploying machine learning models—starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction. Built using Scikit-learn and designed for simplicity, extensibility, and real-world integration.

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end Linear Regression pipeline
- Modular functions for:
  - Data cleaning & transformation
  - Feature-label splitting
  - Model training, evaluation, and saving
  - Interactive predictions via user input
- Scikit-learn compatible
- Configurable and ready for extension
